💡 Quick Start
Basic Classification Example
python
import numpy as np
from neurovision import NeuralNetwork, NeuralNetworkVisualizer
from neurovision.utils.data_loader import generate_complex_dataset

# 1. Generate a complex dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = generate_complex_dataset(
    n_samples=1000, 
    dataset_type='moons'
)

# 2. Create a neural network
nn = NeuralNetwork(
    layers=[2, 16, 8, 1],           # Input: 2 features, Hidden: 16→8, Output: 1
    learning_rate=0.1,              # Adaptive learning rate
    activation='relu',              # ReLU activation for hidden layers
    regularization=0.001,           # L2 regularization
    optimizer='adam'                # Adam optimizer for faster convergence
)

# 3. Train the network
history = nn.train(
    X_train, 
    y_train.reshape(-1, 1), 
    epochs=1000,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_data=(X_test, y_test),
    early_stopping=True,
    patience=50
)

# 4. Evaluate performance
test_metrics = nn.evaluate(X_test, y_test.reshape(-1, 1))
print(f"🎯 Test Accuracy: {test_metrics['accuracy']:.4f}")
print(f"📉 Test Loss: {test_metrics['loss']:.4f}")

# 5. Create comprehensive visualizations
visualizer = NeuralNetworkVisualizer()
dashboard = visualizer.create_dashboard(nn, X_test, y_test, history)
Command Line Interface

🔬 Advanced Usage
Custom Architectures
python
# Deep network for complex patterns
deep_nn = NeuralNetwork(
    layers=[2, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 1],
    learning_rate=0.01,
    activation='leaky_relu'

Live Training Visualization
python
from neurovision.visualization.animator import LiveTrainingVisualizer

# Create live visualizer
visualizer = LiveTrainingVisualizer(nn, X_train, y_train)
visualizer.start()

# Train with real-time updates
history = nn.train(X_train, y_train, epochs=500)

visualizer.stop()
Hyperparameter Optimization
python
from neurovision.utils.metrics import benchmark_performance

# Test multiple configurations
architectures = [[2, 16, 1], [2, 32, 16, 1], [2, 64, 32, 16, 1]]
learning_rates = [0.1, 0.01, 0.001]

results = benchmark_performance(
    architectures, 
    datasets, 
    learning_rate=learning_rates,
    epochs=300
)
Ensemble Methods
python
# Create ensemble of networks
n_models = 5
predictions = []

for i in range(n_models):
    model = NeuralNetwork([2, 16, 8, 1])
    model.train(X_train, y_train, epochs=200)
    pred = model.predict(X_test)
    predictions.append(pred)

# Majority voting
ensemble_pred = (np.mean(predictions, axis=0) > 0.5).astype(int)
